6. The value of y will be some random integer. This is because printf is 2 values to print  but is only recieving one.  Because printf is defined with (...) the parameters are not checked to ensure the
correct parameter passage. C is then forced to just use whatever memory is contained next whichat  this pointis garbage memory and  thus is completely unpredictable of an output. Whatever is stored
in that garbage memory will be forced to be represented as an integer.
